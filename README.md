Repo for Assignment 2 for Game 1402 BVC Winter Term

Scenario
Following the success of your 2D platformer prototype, Nofriendo has greenlit Leap Year 3D, a third person action adventure spinoff. As the lead programmer, you must demonstrate your ability to work in 3D space by building a prototype with responsive character movement, camera systems, and action mechanics. The creative director wants to see how the franchise translates to three dimensions before committing to full production.

Requirements
Part 1: Movement and Camera
Third person character movement in 3D space with responsive controls

Camera system that follows and frames the player (Cinemachine or custom implementation)

Character with animation integration for movement states

Part 2: Action Mechanics
Aiming system appropriate to your game concept

Projectile or object firing mechanic (combat, puzzle, or environmental interaction)

Collision detection and response for projectiles

Part 3: Interaction Systems
Environmental interactions allowing player engagement with objects

Clear feedback for interactive elements

Trigger or proximity-based interactions as appropriate to your design

Part 4: Game Systems
Start menu and pause menu functionality

Complete game loop with win and loss conditions

Audio and visual feedback for player actions

Clear game objective communicated to the player

Part 5: Code Quality
Modular code following C# conventions and object-oriented principles

Git repository with meaningful commit history, including challenge activity branches

Clear, meaningful variable and function names

Part 6: Technical Document
Description of core systems and architecture decisions

Key code snippets with explanations of 3D movement and camera implementation

Debugging challenges encountered and solutions applied

AI tool usage documentation (if applicable)

Submission Details
Type: zip
File Naming: <first-name>-<last-name>-game1402-assignment-2.zip
Submit a compressed archive containing a Windows executable build of your game and your technical document as a PDF. The technical document must include a link to your Git repository.

Linked Course Outcomes
•
Design, develop, and implement a complete game prototype with multiple interconnected mechanics and systems using C# in Unity.
•
Apply object-oriented programming principles and software architecture patterns to create reusable, maintainable, and well-structured game code.
•
Optimize game performance and systematically debug code by identifying and addressing inefficiencies, runtime errors, and resource management issues.
•
Program autonomous behaviors and physics based interactions by applying vector mathematics, raycasting, and algorithms such as Finite State Machines directly in C#.
